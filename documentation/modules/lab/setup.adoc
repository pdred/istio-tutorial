## Download Tutorial Sources

Before we start setting up the environment, let’s clone the tutorial sources and set the `TUTORIAL_HOME` environment variable to point to the root directory of the tutorial:

Before we start setting up the environment, let’s clone the tutorial sources and set the `TUTORIAL_HOME` environment variable to point to the root directory of the tutorial:

```
git clone https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/istio-tutorial istio-tutorial
```

```
export TUTORIAL_HOME="$(pwd)/istio-tutorial"
export USERNAME="your_username"
```

```
cd $TUTORIAL_HOME
```

## Perform the following steps using the `oc` client

First, we'll need to create a work directory:

```
oc new-project istio-devnation
```

Next, we'll need to create the namespace in which we will perform our work:

```
oc new-project `username`-tutorial
```

NOTE: the "`username`-tutorial" command above implies that you will use your username and the prefix for the new namespace. An example would be

```
oc new-project preston-tutorial
```
